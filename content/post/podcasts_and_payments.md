Today Apple [announced](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-leads-the-next-chapter-of-podcasting-with-apple-podcasts-subscriptions/) paid podcast subscriptions. Most people following the podcast ecosystem thought Apple would have done this 5+ years ago. Meanwhile, in the more open ecosystem that is podcasting outside of a small number of companies, [Podcast Index](https://podcastindex.org/) is making steady progress with [Lightning Network based payments for podcasts](https://u.today/father-of-podcasting-integrates-bitcoin-lightning-into-his-app).

While Apple's paid podcast subscriptions are rather tame given that Patreon has been offering podcasters this option for quite some time, Podcast Index's use of [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/) based payments are truly innovative. Beyond using the Bitcoin backed payment system, Podcast Index payments allow podcast listeners to send payments as they listen, on a timed basis (e.g. every 5 minutes) or on-demand. This allows podcast listeners to provide feedback in the way of payments. Did the podcast listener really enjoy that last segment of a podcast? Boost "the sats" (Satoshis, which are the smallest measurement of a Bitcoin) and let the podcaster know how much they appreciated that part of the podcast. While I have my concerns about the viability of Lightning as a payment network, I think the innovation the Podcast Index community is doing in regards to podcast payments is promising and far more creative than what Apple is providing podcasting.
