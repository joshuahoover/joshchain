One of the most common questions I'm asked about blockchain is what it's good for outside of digital currency. Some blockchain enthusiasts will point to DeFi, and rightfully so. DeFi is creating a number of interesting products. However, most people I talk to aren't too interested in what they see as "wall street on the blockchain". Those in tech often want more tangible examples, ideally with code.

Look no further than [this creative application](https://blog.chain.link/craft-whiskey-crypto-payments-with-chainlink-oracles/) of smart contracts on Ethereum utilizing [Chainlink](https://chain.link) as an [oracle](https://blokt.com/guides/chainlink#What_is_an_Oracle_and_how_are_they_useful), [ERC115 tokens](https://docs.ethhub.io/built-on-ethereum/erc-token-standards/erc1155/), and an [Aave](https://docs.aave.com/faq/) interest-bearing pool. Beyond the blockchain buzzword bingo, there is the solution that allows independent distilleries to raise funds for batches of their whiskey as they mature, while allowing investors to liquidate their investment in several ways. [Whiskey MarketMaker](https://whiskey-marketmaker.surge.sh/) applies [smart contract composability](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/composability/) in ways that show how powerful blockchain can be in enabling new opportunities. The article gives a good overview of some of the challenges the developers faced when building the solution, including pointers to the code. It's a good read, especially for those in tech looking for a bit of a deeper dive into a real world solution that shows off the application of several blockchain concepts.
