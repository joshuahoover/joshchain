I wanted to get more hands-on learning with smart contract development, especially Ethereum smart contracts built with the [Solidity programming language](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/). When I did some searches for what the best resources were for this, [cryptozombies.io ](https://cryptozombies.io) kept coming up as the best option. Despite my skepticism, CryptoZombies is a really good way to learn Solidity and smart contract development.

The course expects you to have some programming experience. It wastes no time on explaining programming language basics. The project is built in a way to provide a progressive learning path. Each lesson builds on top of the next one in a nice flow. Key concepts are taught in digestible chunks, which allowed me to dive into some concepts a little deeper with further research without feeling like I was going to get too far off the learning path.

I've taking much more formal training on other programming languages and none of them come close to as effective as CryptoZombies. Best of all? CryptoZombies is free of charge. If you're interested in learning a little bit about smart contract development with Solidity, I highly recommend checking out [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io).
