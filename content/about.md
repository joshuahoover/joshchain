My name is Joshua Hoover. I thought it might be fun to write about blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and decentralization in general on this site with a ridiculous name.

I have [a blog](https://joshuahoover.com) that I sometimes write at, but wanted to play with something other than WordPress for once, so I created this site.

I started to learn about cryptocurrency and blockchain around 2017. I spent close to a year contracting for a startup trying ot build and launch an exchange. That never worked out for oh so many reasons, but the thought of how things were likely to change as a result of cryptocurrencies and blockchain kept sticking with me. I'm not an expert. I'm not an investment guru. I'm just interested in learning more and sharing what I find.
